<h2>3D printed peristaltic pump - OSP2(Open Source Peristaltic Pump) - Arduino-program-controller</h2>

<b>Edit 22/05/2020:</b></br>
Added a schematic(use it for your own risk!) and a fix to the library file UTFT to fix the image if it's inverted.

This project was done a few years ago and to describe all steps needed I need to go back and test it when I have time, but the code for the arduino inside the folder here is tested and working, the second folder contains pictures and text files for the pump configuration, just copy them as they are to the SDcard, and put the SDcard to the screen SDcard slot.

This project is not finished but it is working.

This is the description of the project(also not complete) shared on Google Docs, if you can not open it here:
